# Docket

DOCKEr + torrenT = Docket

Docket is a custom docker registry that allows for deployments through bittorrent.

This was design and built in 48 hours as part of the Gopher Gala Golang 48 hour hackathon.
Hence kindly forgive me for the hackish code, and lack of tests.

[On hind sight - container flood or docker rush would have been a better name.]

## Problem Statement

In 2015, git deploys are soon going to replace docker [or rocket or lxd] deploys.
Large scale deploys are going to choke your docker registry.

## Solution

The solution is BitTorrent. Any technology good for distributing music and movies, is usually good for doing server deploys.

## Features

- Written in Golang :)
- Very easy to use
- Works along side your private docker registry

## Concepts

Docket constitutes of 3 components:

1. Docket Registry

A REST service that acts as a registry. It receives docker image tarballs from the client, stores metadata into a database,
creates torrents out of them and seeds them.

2. Docket Client

The client itnerface in which the end user will be interacting. Can view available images in the registry, push an image to the registry and pull an image (which triggers a bittorrent deploy) from the registry.

3. Bittorrent Tracker

Docket allows you to BYOT (bring your own tracker), but I suggest installing opentracker

Docket uses ctorrent for the actual downloading of torrents.

## Installation

### Step 0: You need to already have Docker installed

### Step 1: Install ctorrent and opentracker

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev make g++ ctorrent
$ git clone https://github.com/gebi/libowfat
$ make
$ git clone git://erdgeist.org/opentracker
$ cd opentracker
$ make
```

### Step 2: Download the Docket binaries

```bash
$ wget http://storage.googleapis.com/docket/docket.zip
$ unzip docket.zip
```

### Step 3: That's all


## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fire up the Tracker

```bash
$ cd opentracker
$ ./opentracker 8940
```

### Step 2: Fire up the Registry

```bash
$ cd registry
# Note you need to put an ip address in which other machines can contact the tracker
# You cannot put in localhost or 127.0.0.1
$ sudo ./registry --tracker "10.240.101.85:8940"
```

## Usage

### Push an image to the Registry

```bash
$ cd client
#Note: You will have to to explicitly mention the tag ":latest"
$ sudo ./client -h "http://10.240.101.85" push netvarun/test:latest
Found image:  netvarun/test:latest

Successfully uploaded image:  netvarun/test:latest  to the Docket registry.
```

### List all images available in the Registry

```bash
$ cd client
$ sudo ./client -h "http://10.240.101.85" images
netvarun/test:latest
perl:latest

```

### Do a deploy

```bash
$ cd client
$ sudo ./client -h "http://10.240.101.85" pull perl:latest
Downloading the torrent file for image:  perl:latest
